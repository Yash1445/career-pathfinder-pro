# Ansible Configuration Files

# This directory is intended for Ansible playbooks and roles.
# You can create your playbooks here to automate deployment and configuration tasks. 

# Example of a simple playbook file
# Create a file named `site.yml` for your main playbook.

# site.yml
- hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure the latest version of the package is installed
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: latest
      loop:
        - git
        - nginx
        - python3-pip

# You can also create roles for better organization.
# Create a directory named `roles` and add your roles there.
