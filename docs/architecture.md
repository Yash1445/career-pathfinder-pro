# Architecture Overview of SkillSync

## 1. Introduction
SkillSync is a comprehensive platform designed to assist users in navigating their career paths through personalized recommendations, skill assessments, and job matching. The architecture is built to support scalability, maintainability, and performance.

## 2. System Architecture
The SkillSync architecture follows a microservices approach, separating concerns across different components:

### 2.1 Frontend
- **Technology Stack**: React.js with Next.js for server-side rendering and improved SEO.
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for managing application state.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
- **Routing**: Dynamic routing using Next.js pages.

### 2.2 Backend
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js with Express.js for RESTful API development.
- **Database**: MongoDB for NoSQL data storage, with Mongoose for object modeling.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 for storing user-uploaded files (e.g., resumes).

### 2.3 AI Models
- **Machine Learning**: Python-based models for career analysis, skill matching, and job recommendations.
- **Model Serving**: Flask/FastAPI for serving machine learning models via RESTful APIs.
- **Data Processing**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.

### 2.4 Mobile Application
- **Technology Stack**: React Native for cross-platform mobile app development.
- **Shared Services**: Utilizes the same backend API as the web application for consistency.

### 2.5 Admin Dashboard
- **Purpose**: Provides analytics and management capabilities for administrators.
- **Technology Stack**: React.js or Vue.js for building the dashboard interface.

## 3. Data Flow
1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the frontend application, which communicates with the backend API.
2. **API Requests**: The frontend sends requests to the backend for data retrieval and manipulation.
3. **Data Processing**: The backend processes the requests, interacts with the database, and may call AI services for advanced analytics.
4. **Response**: The backend sends the response back to the frontend, which updates the UI accordingly.

## 4. Deployment
- **Containerization**: Docker is used to containerize the application components for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers.
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines are set up for automated testing and deployment.

## 5. Conclusion
The SkillSync architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy updates and integration of new features. By leveraging modern technologies and best practices, SkillSync aims to provide a seamless user experience while maintaining robust performance and security.
